<h2>Pottery</h2><br>
  <div class="desc">
      <p>Pottery is clay that is formed, dried, and fired, usually with a glaze or finish, into a platter, cup, vessel or decorative item - clay pottery. Clay is a naturally formed mineral pulled from the earth's surface. Clay is a product commonly found through the world and was used thousands of years ago by humans to form vessels and tools for holding liquid, food and other domestic needs. The versatility and simple production of clay allowed pottery to be used broadly by all cultures. Thus the connection people have to pottery and clay has existed for thousands of years and is part of every culture.
